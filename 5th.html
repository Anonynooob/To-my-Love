        <h1>Hello Lovey!</h1>
        <p> Habang ginagawa ko ito, I find myself reflecting on our journey we’ve shared sa loob ng limang taon. It feels like just yesterday and yet, in the span of these years, we’ve created a different version of reality and beautiful memories together. I want to take this very special moment to express just how deeply you have my heart and how much you mean to me.
Sa totoo lang, your presence has always brought ease and light into my life. Yung tipong laging gumagaan ang mga bagay bagay pag magkasama tayo at pag kasama kita. You have a remarkable way of turning the ordinary into the very special memory for us.
Masaya ako sa mga oras na new things na naexplore natin, mga lugar, pagkain, or iba’t ibang bagay pa. Each adventure we spent, whether it’s expensive or kahit staying evening at home, is a very speciaI memory that has a huge place to my heart.
You’ve seen me at my best and even at my very worst, and you’re still there. Naiinspire ako na maging better para satin, to reach our dreams, and maexperience yung mga bagay bagay na gusto nating maexperience nung mga time na simpleng tao palang tayo.
I love the way you laugh at my jokes, even the korny ones, and how your smile makes me smile too. I love the way you listen even to my nonsense stories. I love the way you make the face na pag naiinis ka hahaha. I love you as a whole.
As we look toward the future, I am filled with excitement and hope na makamit natin yung mga pangarap natin. I know that whatever challenges we may face, we have each other always. I am committed to growing with you, to nurturing our love, and to creating a future that is as beautiful and our favorite weather.
Thank you for being my partner, my cheerleader, my best friend, and my home. Thank you for existing and coming into my life. I am so incredibly grateful for you, and I look forward to many more years of love and happiness with you. </p>
        <p>Your half, L</p>
